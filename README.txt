Hello, and thank you for using my wage calculator!

The program will ask you for a start time and end time 
between 5 PM and 4 PM. It will also ask you for the bed 
time of the child. Simply provide the whole numbered 
hour, as there is no need to provide the minutes or the 
cycle. From there, it will print out the wages earned 
that day. 

Thank you
